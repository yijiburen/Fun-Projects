# Fun-Projects
Due to popular demand, I've made public a number of "just for fun" projects that I've made over the years which helped me understand Python graphics functionality

Projects:

Animation Assignment - Animates the movement of a Lamborghini Aventador on a street. Note the rotating wheel spokes and moving road lines. Locations of points were obtained using AutoDesk

Computer Art - Makes use of many randomly generated terrain features and local coordinate systems to create a battlefield scene. Chooses randomly between 3 themes: field, desert, and snow. Warning: can take a while to load up depending on power of your computer.

Tank Parking Game - Control a tank through a maze full of enemy turret emplacements to its golden parking spot. Use WASD/arrrow keys to move and LMB to shoot.

YIJINMIDE Graphics - Simulates an etching laser, I made it to explore different sinusoidal patterns.

dance_animation - Explores looping of images through an array to create a video. Explored going through RGB colourspace to create smooth colour transitions.
